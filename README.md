# Lighty - Another Light Overlay Mod - With a twist!

[Please visit Modrinth for an overview about the mod!](https://modrinth.com/mod/lighty)

## About Supported Minecraft Versions

Currently, I try to actively support:

- The most recent 1.19.4 snapshot
- 1.19.3
- 1.19.2

Versions I will support as long as it is easy enough to port the changes:

- 1.19.1
- 1.18.2

Support for those versions may be dropped any time.

All of the above boils down to these rules:

- I will support the current stable Minecraft version.
- I will support the latest Minecraft version [Create Fabric](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-fabric) is on.
- I will try to support the most recent snapshot. I will not backport any changes to snapshots.
- Support for any other version may or may not be provided. As long as it is fairly easy to port the changes, there is a good chance I will still support it.

## Differences across Minecraft versions

There may be slight differences between the same Lighty version (for example, `v1.1.0+1.18.2` and `v1.1.0+1.19.3`) because of technical changes. The core feature set (the light overlays) should work similarly though.
